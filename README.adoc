=== SimpleDirect2DApplication

image::demos/SimpleDirect2DApplication/screenshot.png[Screenshot of SimpleDirect2DApplication]

A port of Microsoft's https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/samples/microsoft/windows-classic-samples/simple-direct-2d-application/[Simple Direct2D Application] code example to nim-fww.

This demo demonstrates the use of:

* Direct2D (`fww/d2d1`) for rendering.
* DirectWrite (`fww/dwrite`) for text layout.
* WIC (`fww/wic`) for image loading, resizing and pixel format conversion.
* `fww/win32wm` and `fww/wmworks` for creating windows and responding to events.
* `fww/winres` for compile-time generation of the resource object file with the application manifest and embedded data.

== Design notes

This project only focuses on native Win32 GUI development.
It does not aim for full API coverage (especially if the API is obsolete).
https://github.com/khchen/winim[winim] can be used (in conjunction with nim-fww) if full Win32 API coverage is needed.
